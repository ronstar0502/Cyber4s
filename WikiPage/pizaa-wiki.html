            <p>
             <strong>Pizza</strong> is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), 
             which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a <strong>pizzaiolo</strong>.

                In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
                In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

            <h2>History behind the Pizza</h2>
            <p>
                Foods similar to pizza have been made since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic Age</a>.
                Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>
                during the rule of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great">Darius the Great</a> baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.
            </p>
            <p>
                An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). 
                In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. 
                When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno
            </p>
            <p>
                The first mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
                Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.
                Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.
            </p>
            <p>
                A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. 
                Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag â€” red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). 
                Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although later research cast doubt on this legend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905.
                Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.

            <h2>Prepartion of a Pizza</h2>
            <p>
            Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.
            Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.
            </p>
            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <p>
                In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. 
                The pizza is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. 
                Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.
                When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.
                Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries, in order to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. 
                Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

                </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Crust</h3>
            <p>
                The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to style - thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione.
                Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.
                Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating pizza, especially the crust.
            </p>
            <h3>Cheese</h3>
            <p>
                Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples.
                Other cheeses are also used, particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. 
                This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture.
